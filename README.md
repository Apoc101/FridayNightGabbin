# FridayNightGabbin

A Friday Night Funkin mod with assets from IRL friends

Huge thanks to
Cavo, 
Simo, 
Mattia, 
Jacopo for all their help in supplying and creating the textures

If the Gino Icons are too hard, just go into assets/images/NOTE_assets and just replace them with the original game's icons.
